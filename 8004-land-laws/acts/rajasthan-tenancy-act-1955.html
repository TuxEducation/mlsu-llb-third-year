								<b>Statement of Objects and Reasons Act No. 37 of 2013.</b> - Proviso to sub-section (1) of 45 of the
								Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 provides that for the purpose of agricultural operations in connection with
								such agro-processing and agri-business enterprise as may be approved in the prescribed manner by the
								State Government or any authority appointed by it, a holder of Khudkasht or a land owner may let or a
								Khatedar tenant may sublet whole or any part of his holding for a term of fifteen years and may extend
								such lease or sub-lease for a further period of fifteen years.<p></p>
								To make easy availability of agricultural land for the purpose of plantation of <i>Prosopis
									Juliflora</i> or any other like plantation to be used for generation of electricity it had been
								decided to amend the aforesaid proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 45.<p></p>
								Since the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly was not in session and the circumstances existed which rendered
								it necessary for the Governor of Rajasthan to take immediate action, she, therefore, promulgated the
								Rajasthan Tenancy (Amendment) Ordinance, 2013 (Ordinance No. 18 of 2013) on 2nd August, 2013, which was
								published in the Rajasthan Gazette, Part IV (B) Extraordinary, dated 5th August, 2013.<p></p>
								This Bill seeks to replace the aforesaid Ordinance.<p></p>
								Hence the Bill.<p></p>
